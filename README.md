# Delivery-io

I've used pnpm as my package manager because of its better workspace feature.
To install pnpm 

``` sh
brew install pnpm
```

Before run the application. Install the dependencies.

``` Sh
pnpm install
```

To run both client and backend run the command down below. That will run backend and frontend go to http://localhost:3000 to see the page.

``` sh
pnpm start
```

Run the tests. The command down below will run all tests.

``` sh
pnpm test:all
```
